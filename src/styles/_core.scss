/* Core SCSS
 * 
 * This is used to combine all the core variables and functions into one file
 * This enables the component style to just import from one place like so:
 * `@use "/src/styles/core" as *;`
 * This reduces the amount of prefixing, it's usually not recommended unless
 * for "stylesheets written by you"
 * see: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/
